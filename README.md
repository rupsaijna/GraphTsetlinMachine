*"The Tsetlin machine is a new universal artificial intelligence (AI) method that learns simple logical rules to understand complex things, similar to how an infant uses logic to learn about the world. Being logical, the rules become understandable to humans. Yet, unlike all other intrinsically explainable techniques, Tsetlin machines are drop-in replacements for neural networks by supporting classification, convolution, regression, reinforcement learning, auto-encoding, language models, and natural language processing. They are further ideally suited for cutting-edge hardware solutions of low cost, enabling nanoscale intelligence, ultralow energy consumption, energy harvesting, unrivaled inference speed, and competitive accuracy."*

This project implements the Graph Tsetlin Machine.

## Tutorial 

In this tutorial, you create graphs for the Noisy XOR problem and then train and test the Graph Tsetlin Machine on these.

Noisy XOR gives four kinds of graphs, shown below:

<p align="center">
  <img width="60%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/NoisyXOR.png">
</p>

Observe how each node has one of two properties: **A** or **B**. If both of the graph's nodes have the same property, the graph is given the class label $Y=0$. Otherwise, it is given the class label $Y=1$.

The task of the Graph Tsetlin Machine is to assign the correct class label to each graph when the labels used for training are noisy.

### Initialization

Start by creating the training graphs using the _Graphs_ construct:
```bash
graphs_train = Graphs(
    10000,
    symbols = ['A', 'B'],
    hypervector_size = 32,
    hypervector_bits = 2
)
```
You initialize the graphs as follows:
- *Number of Graphs.* The first number sets how many graphs you are going to create. Here, you prepare for creating _10,000_ graphs.

- *Symbols.* Next, you find the symbols **A** and **B**. You use these symbols to assign properties to the nodes of the graphs. You can define as many symbols as you like. For the Noisy XOR problem, you only need two.

- *Vector Symbolic Representation (Hypervectors).* You also decide how large hypervectors you would like to use to store the symbols. Larger hypervectors room more symbols. Since you only have two symbols, set the size to _32_. Finally, you decide how many bits to use for representing each symbol. Use _2_ bits for this tutorial. You then get _32*31/2 = 496_ unique bit pairs - plenty of space for two symbols!
  
- *Generation and Compilation.* The generation and compilation of hypervectors happen automatically during initialization, using [sparse distributed codes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/917565).

### Adding Nodes

The next step is to set how many nodes you want in each of the _10,000_ graphs you are building. For the Noisy XOR problem, each graph has two nodes:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
    graphs_train.set_number_of_graph_nodes(graph_id, 2)
```
After doing that, you prepare for adding the nodes:
```bash
graphs_train.prepare_node_configuration()
```
You add the two nodes to the graphs as follows, giving them one outgoing edge each:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
   number_of_outgoing_edges = 1
   graphs_train.add_graph_node(graph_id, 'Node 1', number_of_outgoing_edges)
   graphs_train.add_graph_node(graph_id, 'Node 2', number_of_outgoing_edges)
```

### Adding Edges

You are now ready to prepare for adding edges:
```bash
graphs_train.prepare_edge_configuration()
```

Next, you connect the two nodes of each graph:
```bash
for graph_id in range(10000):
    edge_type = "Plain"
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_edge(graph_id, 'Node 1', 'Node 2', edge_type)
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_edge(graph_id, 'Node 2', 'Node 1', edge_type)
```
You need two edges because you build directed graphs, and with two edges you cover both directions. Use only one edge type, named _Plain_.

### Adding Properties and Class Labels

In the last step, you randomly assign property **A** or **B** to each node.
```bash
Y_train = np.empty(10000, dtype=np.uint32)
for graph_id in range(10000):
    x1 = random.choice(['A', 'B'])
    x2 = random.choice(['A', 'B'])

    graphs_train.add_graph_node_property(graph_id, 'Node 1', x1)
    graphs_train.add_graph_node_property(graph_id, 'Node 2', x2)
```
Based on this assignment, you set the class label of the graph. If both nodes get the same property, the class label is _0_. Otherwise, it is _1_.
```bash
    if x1 == x2:
        Y_train[graph_id] = 0
    else:
        Y_train[graph_id] = 1
```
The class label is finally randomly inverted to introduce noise.
```bash
    if np.random.rand() <= 0.01:
        Y_train[graph_id] = 1 - Y_train[graph_id]
```
See the Noisy XOR Demo in the example folder for further details.

## Demos

### Vanilla MNIST

The Graph Tsetlin Machine supports rich data (images, video, text, spectrograms, sound, etc.). One can, for example, add an entire image to a graph node, illustrated for MNIST images below:

<p align="center">
  <img width="40%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/VanillaMNIST.png">
</p>

Here, you define an image by adding its white pixels as properties to the node. Each white pixel in the grid of <i>28x28</i> pixels gets its own symbol W<sub>x,y</sub>.

Note that with only a single node, you obtain a Coalesced Vanilla Tsetlin Machine. See the Vanilla MNIST Demo in the example folder for further details.

### Convolutional MNIST

By using many nodes to capture rich data, you can exploit inherent structure in the data. Below, each MNIST image is broken down into a grid of _19x19_ image patches. A patch then contains _10x10_ pixels:

<p align="center">
  <img width="60%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/ConvolutionalMNIST.png">
</p>

Again, white pixel symbols W<sub>x,y</sub> define the image content. Additionally, this example use a node's location inside the image to enhance the representation. You do this by introducing row R<sub>y</sub> and column C<sub>x</sub> symbols.

These symbols allow the Graph Tsetlin Machine to learn and reason about pixel patterns as well as their location inside the image.

Without adding any edges, the result is a Coalesced Convolutional Tsetlin Machine. See the Convolutional MNIST Demo in the example folder for further details.

### Sequence Classification

The above two examples did not require edges. Here is an example where the edges are essential.

The task is to decide how many 'A's occur in sequence. The 'A's can appear at any time, preceded and followed by spaces. The below graphs model the task: 

<p align="center">
  <img width="60%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/SimpleSequenceProblem.png">
</p>

From the perspective of a single node, the three classes _Y=0_ (one 'A'), _Y=1_ (two 'A's), and _Y=2_ (three 'A's) all look the same. Each node only sees an 'A' or a space. By considering the nodes to its $Left$ and to its $Right$, however, a node can start gathering information about how many 'A's appear in the sequence.

**Remark.** Notice the two types of edges: $Left$ and $Right$. With only a single edge type, a node would not be able distinguish between an 'A' to its left and an 'A' to its right, making the task more difficult. Hence, using two types of edges is beneficial.

See the Sequence Classification Demo in the example folder for further details.

### Noisy XOR With MNIST Images

This example increases the challenge of the Noisy XOR problem by using images of handwritten '0's and '1's instead of the symbols $\textbf{A}$ and $\textbf{B}$. Random selection from the MNIST collection of images gives a diverse range of handwritten digits:

<p align="center">
  <img width="60%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/NoisyXORMNIST.png">
</p>

Again, the white pixels of the images become the node properties (illustrated by the images themselves above). To solve this task, the Graph Tsetlin Machine must both learn the appearance of handwritten '0's and '1', while relating them according to the XOR relation under the guidance of noisy class labels.

See the Noisy XOR MNIST Demo in the example folder for further details.

## Example Use Case

Graph Tsetlin Machines process multimodal data in complex structures. Here is an envisioned example use case from a hospital:

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/GraphTM.png">
</p>

The nodes in the figure capture various kinds of health data, such as [ECG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10181) and the [medical narrative](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8798633) in Electronic Health Records. The different types of edges specify the relationships between the data: _Measurement_ edges relate medical tests to a patient, _Condition_ edges relate diseases to patients, and so on. Machine learning tasks in this setting include: forecasting, alerting, decision-making, situation assessment, risk mitigation, knowledge discovery, and optimization.

## Graph Tsetlin Machine Basics

### Clause-Driven Message Passing

The Graph Tsetlin Machine is based on message passing. As illustrated below, a pool of clauses examines each node in the graph. Whenever a clause matches the properties of a node, it sends a message about its finding through the node's outgoing edges.

<p align="center">
  <img width="75%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/MessagePassing.png">
</p>

When a node receives a message, it appends the message to its properties. In this manner, the messages supplement the node properties with contextual information.

### Logical Reasoning With Nested Clauses

The above message passing enables logical reasoning with nested (deep) clauses. We here use the Sequence Classification Demo to study the reasoning procedure step-by-step, employing a single clause $C:$

<p align="center">
  <img width="70%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/SequenceClassificationInference.png">
</p>

**1) Input Graph.** The example input is a graph with three consecutive $\mathbf{A}$ nodes:

<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/InputGraphSequenceClassification.png">
</p>

**2) Initial Features.** The Graph Tsetlin Machine next describes each node using Boolean features $[\mathbf{A}, Right \otimes C, Left \otimes C]:$

<p align="center">
  <img width="65%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/FeaturesSequenceClassification.png">
</p>

Feature $\mathbf{A}$ tells whether the node has property $\mathbf{A}$. Feature $Left \otimes C$ is a placeholder for the truth value of clause $C$ to the *right*. Note that the operator $\otimes$ is the vector symbolic way of binding two symbols together into a new unit, in this case the edge type $Left$ and the clause $C$. You can consider this binding as an explainable way to name the second feature. Correspondingly, feature $Right \otimes C$ gives the truth value of clause $C$ to the *left*. The Graph Tsetlin Machine initializes the second and third feature to $False$, to be updated by arriving messages. 

**3) Clause Without Message Literals.** To produce the first round of messages, clause $C$ only considers the node properties:

$$C = \textbf{A} \textcolor{lightgray}{\land \Big(Left \otimes C\Big) \land \Big(Right \otimes C\Big)}.$$

The reason is that the truth values of $C$ to the _left_ and to the _right_ are not yet calculated.

**4) Partial Clause Matching; 5) Message Passing; 6) Updated Features.** In these steps, the Graph Tsetlin Machine matches the partial clause against the nodes. This matching gives one truth value per node. Value $True$ then passes along the outgoing edges, updating the features of each node:

<p align="center">
  <img width="90%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/PartialMatchingAndMessagePassingSequenceClassification.png">
</p>

Note that the truth values are set to $False$ by default to minimize the need for message passing.

**7) Full Clause With Message Literals; 8)Full Clause Matching; 9) Evaluation; 10) Classification.** The message literals of the clause (marked in red) can now be activated for full clause matching:

<p align="center">
  <img width="90%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/FullClauseMatchingAndEvaluationSequenceClassification.png">
</p>

The result is an updated truth value per node. Finally, the truth values are ORed together to give the final classification $Y = 2$ (three consecutive $\mathbf{A}s$).

### Deeper Logical Reasoning

The number of message rounds decides the depth of the reasoning. Three layers of reasoning, for instance, consist of local reasoning, followed by two rounds of message passing, illustrated below:

<p align="center">
  <img width="100%" src="https://github.com/cair/GraphTsetlinMachine/blob/master/figures/DeepLogicalLearningAndReasoning.png">
</p>

Initially, the clauses only consider the nodes' properties (marked in black).
* In the first round of message passing, matching clauses send out their messages. These messages supplement the receiving node's properties (marked in red).
* In the second round, the clauses examine the nodes again, now taking into account the first round of messages. Based on this revisit, the clauses produce the second round of messages, marked in blue.
  
This process continues until reaching the desired depth of reasoning, in this case depth three.

### Logical Learning With Nested Clauses

Finally, the Tsetlin Automata Teams update their states based on how the clauses handled the classification task at hand. Notice from the figure how each team operates across the nodes' properties as well as the incorporated messages.  In this manner, they are able to build nested clauses. That is, a clause can draw upon the outcomes of other clauses to create hierarchical clause structures, centered around the various nodes. Hence, the power of the scheme!
